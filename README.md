# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

### Purpose:
This analysis was done in order to further analyze and visualize the ride-sharing data by creating a summary DataFrame of the data by city type and then creating line graphs to visualize the total weekly fares for each city type. Ultimately, this analysis intends to provide information to help improve the ride-sharing experience in terms of pricing and accessibility. 

## Results

Based on the results of the analysis as indicated in Table 1. urban city types have the highest number of total rides with 1,625. Urban cities also have highest number of total drivers and total fares with 2,405 drivers contributing to a total fare of $39,854.38. Rural areas have the lowest number of total rides and total drivers. On the other hand, with an average fare per ride of $34.62 and an average fare per driver of $55.49, rural cities are the highest in these columns. Urban areas have the lowest average fare per ride and fare per driver; it is important to note that there is a difference of $38.92 between the average fare per driver in rural areas and urban areas. Suburban areas have 5 times the rides as rural cities and close to 6 times more drivers as well. There is still a difference of $22.93 between the average fare per driver in suburban cities and urban cities. While average fares are higher in rural and suburban areas, this is the opposite for total fares. These fare trends are reflected in the figure below showing the total fares by city type; urban cities are at the top, followed by suburban cities, and rural cities at the bottom.

## Summary

The differences in the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type highlighted above may provide crucial information on steps the company needs to take to move forward. For example, both suburban and rural areas have fewer drivers than total rides, therefore, increasing more drivers in these areas may help decrease the average fare per ride and potentially increase total number of rides. The average fare per ride is highest in rural areas, this most likely means the rides are also longer in distance meaning more drivers can help bridge gaps in specific locations as well. On the other hand, urban areas have more drivers than the total number of rides, it may be beneficial to place a limit on new drivers to increase the average fare per driver and perhaps retain more drivers for the future.
